                                    Welcome peeps! I am Govind P Lal, from Kerala, India. This is a webpage that I have created for learning purpose.
                                    Waiting to hear more about me? Well, you'll get to know soon.
                                    I am a coding enthusiast and is currently undergoing my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering,with 
                                    Mar Athanasius College of Engineering under the Kerala Technical University, India.<br>
                                    Wondering why I chose Mechanical Engineering if I am interested in coding and stuff ? I happen to hear that question a lot.
                                    Here's why! After I completed my entrance exams, everyone around asked me about the branch which I was going to choose as 
                                    my career path. The trend then was to take Computer Science. I had no intention to follow the trend.I wanted to be on the 
                                    product design field and to be more specific automobile design. I also had this intention of pursuing my career in robotics later.
                                    Mechanical Engineering satisfied both these conditions and I chose it as my branch against all odds.<br>

                                    As I was nearing the completion of my first year in college, Covid-19 hit the world and everything went online. Although it seemed
                                    difficult at first, we all, you and me coped up with the situation. I found many courses online and went for python programming.
                                    I struggled in the beginning as I did not have a computer science background. But eventually after a few months I completed the basics
                                    of python and started solving problems in <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank">Hackerrank</a>. I started with the very
                                    basic problems and as I moved on I got more interested and I started learning more. I started learning Data Stuctures and Algorithms and
                                    started solving problems on the topics. I also participated in some coding competitions.

                                    All this grew my interest in the computer science field and I wanted to learn more. That's when I saw an online course on the <a href="https://in.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a>
                                    platform which was on Data Science. I attended the course and learned the basics of Data Science and Data Visualization. After this, I went
                                    for web development. This time it was very hard. I struggled to learn about how the internet works, search engine optimization and all that stuff.
                                    But I took it slowly and learned HTML,CSS and Javascript. I know that this is a very basic webpage and it is a cakewalk for many of you. I am 
                                    putting effort in learning more and this webpage is just an initial step.
